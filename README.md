- Handling Edge Cases: For instance, in functions like 'find_price_for_customer,' entering a non-existing customer returns an empty list but also prints "customer not found."
- Understanding Unit Tests: The current testing methodology relies on manual checks and does not fully utilize unit tests, representing a potential area for improvement.
- Future Improvement: Consider improving the testing process by delving deeper into unit testing frameworks to automate and validate various functionalities systematically.

## Final Reflection
Creating this project was a rewarding experience as it marked my first meaningful application of programming skills to solve a real work-related challenge. It significantly reduced the time spent on daily invoicing tasks, saving at least 50% of my time compared to manual Excel checks. While Excel has a search function, finding specific products across multiple stores remained cumbersome, motivating me to create this tool.

Interacting with Excel through Python taught me valuable skills in breaking down complex functions. This project fulfills my goal of streamlining the invoicing process, improving efficiency, and minimizing errors. Although I couldn't integrate real-time data retrieval from QuickBooks due to time constraints, I aim to explore enhancements in the future.

Overall, this project has been an enlightening learning experience, blending programming knowledge with practical application, significantly benefiting my daily work tasks and exceeding my initial objectives.
